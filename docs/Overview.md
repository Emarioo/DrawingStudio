# What it should be
You use the program to design things. Draw diagrams, boxes, maps and thoughts.

When designing you do not want to think about, oohh that's the edge of the image, i have to scale things down. NO, you just design where and however you want, the program deals with your mess and makes it renderable.

The only tool you have is a brush with color and size.

What you paint is lossy. Data is lost to minimize memory usage.
