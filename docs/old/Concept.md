## Inspiration
Most features taken from popular programs like aesprite and paint.net.

The application will be easy to understand, smooth and easy at a glance but very complex and thought through beneath the surface.

One feature is to draw anywhere you want. Like a sketch mode.
You don't need to worry about how big the image is in pixels. You can just draw anywhere. DrawingStudio gathers everything you draw and compresses it into multiple images which are put into one file.

When saving sketch the format may be .dss (DrawStudioSketch). This file can only be viewed by drawingstudio. Therefore, an option to automatically save a file the same file but .png instead which shows a sample of the image. (you can put this into obsidian for example)

# Using Engone
It has a lot of useful things for a program.
Using the same method as the particle system for rendering could improve performance.
## GLFW and OpenGL
For rendering and window.

## OpenCV
For detecting pencil from camera and drawing.
