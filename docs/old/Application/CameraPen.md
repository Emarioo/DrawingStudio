# Two stages

## Resize
The purpose here is to focus on an area in the image where you then calculate the state of the pen. This stage is active when the pen is lost. The area is calculated through moment. An area which has a lot of moment under a certain amount of time will be focused.
## Pen
Pressed or floating, movement, maybe pressure?


# Other way?
## Simple detection
Detect where in the frame the pen is. The pen can be seen as a thick line and distinguishable from it's surroundings.
## Fine movement
